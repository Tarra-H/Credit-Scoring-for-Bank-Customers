# Credit-Scoring-for-Bank-Customers
The purpose of this project is to prepare a report for the credit division of a bank. We will determine the impact of a customer's marital status and the number of children they have on the probability of defaulting on loan repayments. The bank already has some data on customer creditworthiness.

This report will be considered when making credit assessments for prospective customers. Credit assessments are used to evaluate the ability of potential borrowers to repay their loans.
